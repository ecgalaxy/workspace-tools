# Workspace tools

This Ansible playbook provides tools and automated configuration for developers' workspaces.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x with the `venv` module (`apt install python3-venv`), Ansible does *not* need to be installed.
- The tools are installed system-wide, so administrative access is necessary.

## Usage

```
sudo ./exec.sh
```
